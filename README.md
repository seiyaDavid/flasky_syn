   - Select between standard or advanced statistical methods
   - Optionally select a deep learning model for numeric data
5. **Additional options**:
   - Enable distribution visualizations
   - Save the generated dataset
6. **Generate synthetic data**: Click the "Generate Synthetic Data" button
7. **Review results**: Compare the original and synthetic data
8. **Download**: Download the synthetic dataset as a CSV file

## Technical Details

### Model Selection Guidelines

- **Small Datasets (< 100 rows)**:
  - Statistical methods are recommended
  - Deep learning models may overfit

- **Medium Datasets (100-1000 rows)**:
  - VAE or statistical methods work well
  - GANs may require more tuning

- **Large Datasets (> 1000 rows)**:
  - All models perform well
  - GANs and Transformers can capture more complex patterns

- **Highly Structured Data**:
  - Transformers excel at capturing structural relationships
  - Pattern-based statistical methods for sequential/cyclical data

- **Complex Distributions**:
  - GANs for multimodal or complex distributions
  - KDE for simpler non-normal distributions

### Performance Considerations

- Deep learning models require more computational resources
- Training time increases with dataset size and model complexity
- The application includes fallback mechanisms if models fail to converge

## Dependencies

The application requires the following Python packages:

- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Statistical Analysis**: SciPy, Scikit-learn
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Faker
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch

## Privacy Considerations

The synthetic data generated by this tool:

- Cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal the original data
- Preserves statistical properties for analysis
- Maintains relationships between variables
- Is suitable for sharing, testing, and development purposes
- Should still be evaluated for potential privacy risks in highly sensitive contexts

## Business Value

### Regulatory Compliance
- Helps meet GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA and other privacy regulations
- Enables data sharing while protecting personal information
- Reduces risk of data breaches involving sensitive information

### Data Democratization
- Allows wider access to data that resembles production data
- Enables testing and development without privacy concerns
- Facilitates collaboration with external partners

### Cost Reduction
- Eliminates need for complex data masking solutions
- Reduces overhead of managing access to sensitive data
- Minimizes risk of compliance violations and associated penalties
